= Configuring DebugWebModule

[[configure-root-path]]
== Root path

The root path is configured by setting the `debugWebModule.root-path` property.
This can only be done when configuring the `AcrossContext`, before it has bootstrapped.
If no custom root path is configured, the default is */debug*.

== Dashboard (landing page)

Pointing your web browser at the root path within your application will open DebugWebModule on the dashboard.
By default the dashboard has no content other than the top menu.
If you would like a particular controller to open you can set another relative path on the *debugWebModule.dashboard* property.
The path should not contain the root path prefix.
